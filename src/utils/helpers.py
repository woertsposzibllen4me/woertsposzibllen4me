def construct_script_name(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Construct a script name from a file path for further use.

    This function extracts a meaningful module name from the file path to avoid the
    generic `__main__` name appearing in logs when scripts are run directly or as
    subprocesses. It also play a major role in subprocesses identification by our
    terminal_window_manager (tmw) module.

    For main.py entry points, the parent directory name is automatically prefixed to
    make them distinguishable (e.g., "shopwatcher_main" instead of just "main").

    Args:
        file_path: The file path of the script. Pass `__file__`.

    Returns:
        The base name of the file without extension, with parent directory prefix for
        main.py files.

    Example:
        # Regular module
        SCRIPT_NAME = construct_script_name(__file__)  # "shop_tracker"

        # Main entry point (automatically prefixed)
        SCRIPT_NAME = construct_script_name(__file__)  # "shopwatcher_main"
